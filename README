DESCRIPTION
    This module generates commands for the "Epson RP-U420 invoice" printer
    for printing the Unified Invoice in Taiwan.

    You must install the driver and printer processor properly before you
    can use the module.

    You can define multiple lines of headers that will appear on each page
    of the printed invoices, and when you do println the module does all the
    necessary paging and stamping for you.

METHODS
  new
  init_printer
  feed( $lines )
    Feed $lines lines, default is 1.

  stamp
    Make the printer stamp on the invoice. note that you generally don't
    want to call this method directly, due to the stamp positioning. When
    you call "cut", the module automatically detects the correct place to
    stamp for the next invoice.

  cut
    feed the current invoice and cut, as well as stamping on the next
    invoice.

  print
    Low level print function.

  println
    Print a line on the invoice. Does all the paging logic here.

  TODO
    *   Split the device control parts into "Device::Serial::U420" for
        generic use and keep the paging/stamping logic here

    *   Tests

    *   Add footer support
